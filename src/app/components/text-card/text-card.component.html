                    <p>
                        Black hat hackers are malicious hackers, sometimes called crackers. 
                        Black hats lack ethics, sometimes violate laws, and break into computer systems 
                        with malicious intent, and they may violate the confidentiality, integrity, 
                        or availability of an organization's systems and data.
